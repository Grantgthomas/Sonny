# Sonny

Hello and welcome to Sonny!

Sonny is a workday automation bot which will apply to workday jobs for you.

The flags for using Sonny are displayed bellow:
  
    -r  (Optional) Used to designate a JSON (.json) file which will be used to 
  
    -a  (Required) Used to designate a CSV (.csv) file which will contain the addresses of workday applications
  
Here is an example use of Sonny:

    Python3 main.py -r myData.json -a sites.csv

The UserDataModel.json file is an example user file which you can use to fill out your own information.

If there are any workday jobs which you apply for that can't be processed by Sonny please contact me so I can make updates to improve the functionality.

Please also feel free to make your own improvements to Sonny as well.

Disclamer - Sonny stores and uses a lot of personal data in the .json file. DO NOT share this file with anyone for your own safety. Sonny strictly interacts with Workday and does use your information unless it is for a job application.
